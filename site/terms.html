    <h2 id="payments">Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>
      This site functions merely a bulletin board with links to individual
      PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App accounts. This site does not process any
      payments, nor do we provide any funding. Any payments made as a result of this site are subject to terms
      of the payment processor (PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App) and are a personal
      matter between the payer and the recipient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any disputes in payments should be taken up with the payment processor
      directly (PayPal, Venmo, Cash App).
    </p>

    <h2 id="data">Verifying and Updating Data</h2>
    <p>
      Workers and businesses listed on this site are self-reported and are not
      individually verified. Submissions are briefly reviewed by volunteers
      before being posted, but are not personally verified. Please keep in mind
      that typos do happen and mistakes are sometimes made.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find a mistake on the site, please
      <a href="https://forms.gle/ApQUChduP51yZ6Gr5">contact us using this form</a>
      and a volunteer will help.
    </p>

    <h2 id="fraud">Reporting Fraud</h2>
    <p>
      Once again, workers and businesses listed on this site are self-reported
      and are not individually verified. If you believe someone listed on this
      site is not an employee or not a real business, please
      <a href="https://forms.gle/ApQUChduP51yZ6Gr5">contact us using this form</a>
      and provide the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Is it possible that the person you are reporting goes by a different
        name? Please ask other workers or managers of the business if this is
        possible before claiming fraud.
      </li>
      <li>
        Is it possible that the person you are reporting has listed the
        business name incorrectly? Are there other businesses in the area with
        similar names?
      </li>
      <li>
        What reason do you have to believe this person is fraudulent? (i.e. do
        you work at this business).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="owners">Business Owners</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a business owner and wish to contact us to update information
      about your business, or provide tip-matching, please follow these steps
      to verify ownership:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="">Contact us using this form</a>
        Including the name of the business and the name of the owner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide an email address that matches your business website domain,
        or an email address that is listed on an official business registry such
        as your Facebook page, Yelp page, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        After receiving your contact form submission, a volunteer will then
        reach out to the email you provided to verify ownership.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="tax">Tax Advice</h2>
    <p>
      We can not provide tax advice, receipts, or any financial information.
      If you are looking for a tax write-off, ask an accountant, or donate
      instead to a registered non-profit charity.
